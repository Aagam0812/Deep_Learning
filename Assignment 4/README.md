## 🤖 Custom Agents From Scratch

### CSV Reader
📄 The CSV Reader agent is our first step towards simplifying data analysis. It efficiently parses and interprets data from CSV files, enabling users to quickly analyze and visualize complex datasets.

### PDF Reader
📚 Our PDF Reader agent is designed to navigate through the complexities of PDF files. It extracts and processes information, transforming unstructured data into accessible insights.

### Note Taker
📝 The Note Taker agent excels in synthesizing information. Whether during meetings or lectures, it's your personal assistant for jotting down essential notes and capturing important details.

## 💡 AI Agents with LangChain

### Zero-Shot
🎯 The Zero-Shot agent demonstrates our capability to apply models to tasks they weren't specifically trained for, showcasing remarkable adaptability and inference skills across diverse datasets.

### Conversational
💬 This agent enhances user interactions through natural, flowing conversations. It's built to understand context, answer questions, and engage users in meaningful dialogue, elevating the user experience.

### DocSearch
🔍 The DocSearch agent redefines how we search through documents. By understanding the content's context, it delivers precise answers to queries, making information retrieval swift and accurate.

### Self-Ask with Search
🤔 Our innovative Self-Ask with Search agent automates query generation and information seeking. It independently formulates questions and searches for answers, streamlining the discovery process.
